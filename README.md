# Article-REST-API

## This is an api that is RESTful in nature. I made this to practice the architecture and to understand the ins and outs of it.
## This api is capable of posting articles, getting all articles, getting individual articles, putting articles, patching articles, and deleting articles.

### It is hooked up to a hypothetical database and allows users to manipulate the data in a predictable manner
